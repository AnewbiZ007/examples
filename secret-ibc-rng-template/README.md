### Cross-chain random numbers demo

This documentation serves as a demo on how to send cross-chain random numbers from Secret Network testnet to Juno testnet via IBC. The demo repository can be cloned here.

The design system weâ€™ll be using consists of one Secret contract and two Juno contracts:

- Secret Proxy Contract: A Secret contract that requests a random number and specifies the callback information for the response.
- Juno Proxy Contract: A Juno contract that sends an IBC message to fetch the random number from the Secret Network proxy contract.
- Juno Consumer Contract: A Juno contract that consumes the random numbers generated by the Secret proxy contract.

See the [Secret Network docs](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/development-concepts/randomness-api/cross-chain-ibc-randomness) for a detailed walk through of this repository.
